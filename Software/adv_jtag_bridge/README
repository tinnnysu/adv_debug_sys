These are the notes for building the Advanced JTAG Bridge program.

BUILDING

This program doesn't use automake.  It has been developed using the cygwin 
environment under winXP, and should also compile under various GNU/Linux 
distributions.  It has been tested and in known to work with Ubuntu 9.04.
There are two sets of build flags defined in the Makefile, 
one for cygwin and one for Linux - one set is used, one is commented out.  
Edit the Makefile for your system, type "make," and see what happens...

The program may be built with support for the Advanced Debug Interface
(the default), or the legacy "debug_if" interface.  To compile for the
legacy interface, __LEGACY__ should be added to CFLAGS in the Makefile
(the line is present but commented out by default).  Note that support
for the two different debug hardware units is mutually exclusive; both
cannot be supported in the same build.

DEPENDENCIES

Adv_jtag_bridge has three dependencies:

- The pthreads library (probably already installed)
- Cygwin only:  libioperm (for parallel port device access permissions)
- libusb

Since adv_jtag_bridge was written, a newer version of libusb has been 
released (1.0), which used a different interface.  We still use the old 
interface (0.1), so be sure you install the "compatibility layer" if you 
install the latest libusb.  As of December 2008, libUSB-Win32 still used 
v0.1, so cygwin users may not need to install any additional compatibility 
layer.

BUGS

GDB 6.8 has a bug which prevents it from working when no stack frame is 
present (such as at start-up on a bare-metal debugger, such as this one).  
A simple patch applied to GDB 6.8 will work around the problem (a general 
solution is not yet available).  This patch can be found in the source
directory of adv_jtag_bridge as "gdb-6.8-bz436037-reg-no-longer-active.patch".
