These are the notes for building the Advanced JTAG Bridge program.

BUILDING

This program doesn't use automake.  It has been developed using the cygwin 
environment under winXP, and should also compile under various GNU/Linux 
distributions.  It has been tested and is known to work with Ubuntu 9.04.
There are two sets of build flags defined in the Makefile, 
one for cygwin and one for Linux - one set is used, one is commented out.  
Edit the Makefile for your system: set BUILD_ENVIRONMENT to either "cygwin"
or "linux" (no quotes).

The program may be built with support for the Advanced Debug Interface
(the default), or the legacy "debug_if" interface.  To compile for the
legacy interface, __LEGACY__ should be added to CFLAGS in the Makefile
(the line is present but commented out by default).  This is done via 
the SUPPORT_LEGACY flag; set true to build for the legacy debug system,
false (to build for the adv_dbg_if) is the default. Note that support
for the two different debug hardware units is mutually exclusive; both
cannot be supported in the same build.

If you are only going to use a parallel JTAG cable, and you don't want
to bother with libusb, you can set SUPPORT_USB_CABLES to false.  Default
is true.  Similarly, you can set SUPPORT_FTDI_CABLES false if you don't
intend to use FT2232-based JTAG cables, and don't want to bother with
libftdi.

Some users have reported problems getting their USB-Blaster cables to
work using the standard driver.  An alternate, libftdi-based driver
has been added as a compile-time option.  Set
USE_ALT_FTDI_USBBLASTER_DRIVER true to try the alternate driver; note
the two different drivers are mutually exclusive.

In release 2.0 and later, the adv_dbg_if core includes a "hi-speed"
mode, which is used by default.  This requires a protocol change,
and so the adv_jtag_bridge must be built to match the build options
used when synthesizing the adv_dbg_if. For hi-speed mode, set
USE_HISPEED true (this is the default).  For the older mode, set
USE_HISPEED to false. 

DEPENDENCIES

Adv_jtag_bridge has three (or four) dependencies:

- The pthreads library (probably already installed)
- Cygwin only:  libioperm (for parallel port device access permissions)
- libusb
- libftdi

Since adv_jtag_bridge was written, a newer version of libusb has been 
released (1.0), which used a different interface.  We still use the old 
interface (0.1), so be sure you install the "compatibility layer" if you 
install the latest libusb.  As of December 2008, libUSB-Win32 still used 
v0.1, so cygwin users may not need to install any additional compatibility 
layer.

The libftdi library is optional, and only required if you are building
support for FT2232-based cables (SUPPORT_FTDI_CABLES is true).

BUGS

GDB 6.8 has a bug which prevents it from working when no stack frame is 
present (such as at start-up on a bare-metal debugger, such as this one).  
A simple patch applied to GDB 6.8 will work around the problem (a general 
solution is not yet available).  This patch can be found in the source
directory of adv_jtag_bridge as "gdb-6.8-bz436037-reg-no-longer-active.patch".
